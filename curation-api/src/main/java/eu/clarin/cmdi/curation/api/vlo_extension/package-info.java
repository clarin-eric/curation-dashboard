 * The vlo_extension package has basically to goals: 
 * 1. To distinguish between public and non-public profiles for different treatment in caching
 * 2. To assure the presence of some custom facets like schemaLocation,
 * which we need imperatively in the CMDIData object but which are not defined
 * in the standard facetConfig.xml file
